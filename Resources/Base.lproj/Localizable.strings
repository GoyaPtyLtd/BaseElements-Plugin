It only converts between the two container formats, of file and image.  So you can't use it to change the format of the contents of an email from PDF to JPEG for example.\n\nYou would use this function when you have a image file stored in a container that is showing as a file, rather than a picture.  You use this function to alter the internal storage option to image so that it will display a preview.\n\nUse this function with a Set Field script step to convert from a container field stored as a file into a container image or vice versa.  It can be used to set into the same field as the one referenced in the function parameter.\n\n1. If only the field is supplied then it is converted to \"FILE\"\n2. If \"ZLIB\" is supplied the file is compressed\n.
