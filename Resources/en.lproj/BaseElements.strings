It can be used to set into the same field as the one referenced in the function parameter.\n\n1. If only the field is supplied then it is converted to \"FILE\"\n2. If \"ZLIB\" is supplied the file is compressed\n3. Other known formats are:\n- \"snd \" *\n- \"JPEG\"\n- \"GIFf\" *\n- \"EPS \" *\n- \"META\" *\n- \"PNGf\"\n- \"BMPf\" *\n- \"PDF \"\n\n* = not tested.\n\nIf the width and height are not supplied FM appears to display the image correctly but GetWidth and GetHeight return 0. However, GetContainerAttribute ( Test::Data ; \"width\" ) and GetContainerAttribute ( Test::Data ; \"height\" ) with both return the correct value so running the following\n\nBE_ConvertContainer ( Test::File ; \"JPEG\" ; GetContainerAttribute ( Test::Data ; \"width\" ) ; GetContainerAttribute ( Test::Data ; \"height\" ) )\n\ntwice from a script will get things set correctly. ( in other words you have a file, insert it as an image with no sizes, then get FMP to tell you the sizes, then insert it again with those sizes, and it will display properly. )";
