## BaseElements Plugin Sponsorship

**The plugin is free to use**

The BaseElements plugin is, and always will be free and open source. It will never contain any registration code or restrictions on what you can do with it, or how you use it in your solutions.

**Sponsor and support options** 

Goya doesn't provide free support for implementing the plugin in your solution or help with how to make it do what you want.  There is a new [Discussions](https://github.com/GoyaPtyLtd/BaseElements-Plugin/discussions) area on GitHub which you can use to speak to the community about how you're using the plugin and you can search for and ask questions there.

To attempt to recover the costs of providing the function, we have paid mechanisms to access support and receive notifications of new releases. With our annual sponsorship of

[$199 per developer](https://github.com/sponsors/GoyaPtyLtd)

You can become a sponsor and get assistance with the plugin and implementing it in your solutions.

Sponsors also get access to :

* A dropbox share of every released version of the plugin with instant updates.
* Access to beta releases to test new functionality.
* A suite of example files.
* Priority support on GutHub Issues.
* A say in what functions will be added in the future, and the ability to suggest new functionality.
* A warm fuzzy feeling that you're supporting something that all FileMaker developers can benefit from.

**PLUS** : without having to build the plugin themselves, they get access to the [Pro Version](ProVersion.md), which contains functionality not in the public Free version, and will contain any new functionality as priority before being released in the Free version.

**Can you help me with the plugin?**

Yes.  :)  That's what the sponsor option is for, you can use the support options to get guidance and direction about how to use the plugin functions in your own solution.  Whether you've got a complex SOAP integration and need help with XML and XPath, or some weird cURL issue, if the plugin can do it, we'll help you with it.

We've built a heap of sample files for sponsors to show them exactly how to do that one weird thing they're trying to achieve but not sure how to get working.

If you've got a similar issue, give the sponsor option a go.
 

### Thanks already

Finally we would like to thank the people who have previously donated code, funded specific functions, or just sent us some money to say thanks. All of these people and their companies donated before our sponsorship option was available. Some in small amounts and some in large amounts, and we are greatful for their support.
