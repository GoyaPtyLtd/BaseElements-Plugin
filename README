Building
=======================================================================

The following notes describe the process for building the the plugin and the third-party libraries used. The instructions are supplied "as is" in the hope they may be of assistance.

Notes:
- these instructions apply to version 1.3.2 of the BaseElements Plugin
- the instructions contain some full paths and also paths containing version numbers that will likely need to be changed

=======================================================================
Mac OS X
=======================================================================

Version 1.3.2 of the plug-in was built using Xcode 3.2.6 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.

Download the Mac version of the FileMaker External Plug-In API from

	http://www.filemaker.com/support/technologies/

and place the FMWrapper.framework in the Libraries directory.

On the Mac most of the required headers and library files are installed by default on the system. The only third-party libraries that need to be built are OpenSSL and the Boost FileSystem, System and Thread libraries.

=======================================================================
Boost
=======================================================================

Boost is available from

	http://www.boost.org/

Note: v1.3.2 of the plug-in requires Boost 1.47_0 (or later).

The plug-in is a universal binary and the boost libraries should be built accordingly. For example:

	cd boost_1_47_0
	./bootstrap.sh
	./b2 architecture=combined link=static runtime-link=static --with-thread --with-filesystem3

See

	more/getting_started/index.html

for for further information on compiling the Boost libraries.

The boost headers must be placed in the Headers directory and the

	bin.v2/libs/filesystem/build/darwin-4.2.1/release/architecture-combined/link-static/runtime-link-static/threading-multi/libboost_filesystem.a
	bin.v2/libs/thread/build/darwin-4.2.1/release/architecture-combined/link-static/threading-multi/libboost_thread.a
	bin.v2/libs/system/build/darwin-4.2.1/release/architecture-combined/link-static/threading-multi/libboost_system.a

libraries placed in the Libraries directory.

=======================================================================
minizip
=======================================================================

Download the zlib source from

	http://www.zlib.net/

and extract the folder zlib-1.2.5 to the desktop. Copy the minizip directory from the contrib directory in the zlib distribution to the Source directory.


=======================================================================
OpenSSL
=======================================================================

To follow... for the moment copy OpenSSL.framework from inside the FileMaker 11 application package into the Libraries folder.


=======================================================================
Windows
=======================================================================

The plug-in was built using Visual Studio 2010 Professional on Windows 7 Ultimate.

Download the Windows version of the FileMaker External Plug-In API from

	http://www.filemaker.com/support/technologies/

rename the Headers directory FMWrapper and place it in the Headers directory. FMWrapper.lib should be placed the Libraries directory.

The BaseElements plug-in is built as a static library and all third-party libraries must be built from source as static libraries (/MTd & /MT) using libcmt.lib and nafxcw.lib for release and libcrtd.lib and nafxcwd.lib for debug builds.

Note: source code for some of the libraries is supplied as gzipped tar archives; there are a number of applications that can unpack these archives, for example, Stuffit Expander

	http://www.stuffit.com/win-expander.html


=======================================================================
Boost
=======================================================================

The Boost FileSystem and System libraries are required.

	http://www.boost.org/

Note: v1.3.2 of the plug-in requires Boost 1.47 (or later).

See

	more/getting_started/index.html

for instructions on compiling the Boost libraries. In general

	cd boost_1_47_0
	bootstrap.bat
	b2 link=static runtime-link=static --with-thread --with-filesystem --with-date_time

should do the trick.

The boost headers must be placed in the Headers directory and the libraries copied from

	bin.v2\libs\date_time\build\msvc-10.0\release\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_date_time-vc100-mt-s-1_47_0.lib
	bin.v2\libs\filesystem\build\msvc-10.0\release\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_filesystem-vc100-mt-s-1_47_0.lib
	bin.v2\libs\thread\build\msvc-10.0\release\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_thread-vc100-mt-s-1_47_0.lib
	bin.v2\libs\system\build\msvc-10.0\release\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_system-vc100-mt-s-1_47_0.lib

into the Libraries directory. For debug builds also copy

	bin.v2\libs\date_time\build\msvc-10.0\debug\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_date_time-vc100-mt-sgd-1_47_0.lib
	bin.v2\libs\filesystem\build\msvc-10.0\debug\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_filesystem-vc100-mt-sgd-1_47_0.lib
	bin.v2\libs\thread\build\msvc-10.0\debug\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_thread-vc100-mt-sgd-1_47_0.lib
	bin.v2\libs\system\build\msvc-10.0\debug\link-static\runtime-link-static\threading-multi\libboost_system-vc100-mt-sgd-1_47_0.lib


=======================================================================
zlib
=======================================================================

Building zlib is straightforward. Download the zlib source from

	http://www.zlib.net/

and extract the folder zlib-1.2.5 to the desktop.

Open the solution file "contrib/vstudio/vc10/zlibvc.sln" and from the "Build Menu" select "Configuration Manager" and, once in the Configuration Manager, select "ReleaseWithoutAsm" as the "Active solution configuration".

Remove ZLIB_WINAPI from the list of preprocessor definitions.

Build the library and move

	contrib/vstudio/vc10/x86/ZlibStatReleaseWithoutAsm/zlibstat.lib

in the Libraries directory and zlib.h in the Headers directory.


=======================================================================
minizip
=======================================================================

Copy the minizip directory from the contrib directory in the zlib distribution to the Source directory.


=======================================================================
libiconv & libcharset
=======================================================================

Download the source from

	http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

libiconv does not have any support for building using Visual Studio (and if you can get usable binaries following the supplied instructions you're doing better than I).

Place the VS solution and project files from the Project\Extras\libiconv directory into the libiconv-1.13.1 directory then open the solution file

	iconv.sln

Rename

	libcharset\include\libcharset.h.in
	libcharset\include\localcharset.h.in
	include\iconv.h.in
	lib\config.h.in

so that the ".in" suffix is removed.

Open the iconv.sln file and then edit

	include\iconv.h

replacing the line

	extern @DLL_VARIABLE@ int _libiconv_version; /* Likewise */

with

	#if 1 && BUILDING_LIBICONV
	#define LIBICONV_DLL_EXPORTED __attribute__((__visibility__("default")))
	#else
	#define LIBICONV_DLL_EXPORTED
	#endif
	extern LIBICONV_DLL_EXPORTED  int _libiconv_version; /* Likewise */

and the line

	extern size_t iconv (iconv_t cd, @ICONV_CONST@ char* * inbuf, size_t *inbytesleft, char* * outbuf, size_t *outbytesleft);

with

	extern LIBICONV_DLL_EXPORTED size_t iconv (iconv_t cd,  char* * inbuf, size_t *inbytesleft, char* * outbuf, size_t *outbytesleft);

Replace the two lines

	#if @USE_MBSTATE_T@
	#if @BROKEN_WCHAR_H@

with

	#if 1
	#if 0

the line

	#if @USE_MBSTATE_T@

with

	#if 1

and, finally, replace

	#if @HAVE_WCHAR_T@

with

	#if 1


Build the release configuration.

Place the libraries

	Release\libcharset.lib

and

	Release\iconv.lib

into the libraries directory and copy the file include\iconv.h into a directory, iconv, inside the Headers directory.


=======================================================================
libxml2
=======================================================================

Download the source from

	http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

and expand it into a directory on the Desktop.

Note: the full path of the directory should not contain any spaces.

Open a Command Prompt and set up the Visual Studio command line environment

	c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat

then move to the win32 directory in the archive

	cd Desktop\libxml2-2.7.8\win32

Edit the file

	Makefile.msvc

by changing the line

	LIBS = $(LIBS) iconv.lib

to read

	LIBS = $(LIBS) iconv.lib libcharset.lib

and commenting out the lines

	+!if "$(WITH_ICU)" == "1"
	+LIBS = $(LIBS) icu.lib
	+!endif

and

	DFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) /OPT:NOWIN98

Run the commands (changing the include= & lib= paths as appropriate)

	cscript configure.js static=yes debug=no cruntime=-MT include="\\VBOXSVR\BaseElements-Plugin\Headers\iconv" lib="\\VBOXSVR\BaseElements-Plugin\Libraries"
	nmake -f Makefile.msvc MFLAGS=-MT libxmla

to configure and build the source.

Finally, place the headers directory

	libxml2-2.7.8\include\libxml

in the Headers directory and copy the library itself

	bin.msvc\libxml2_a.lib

into the Libraries directory.

=======================================================================
libxslt & libexslt
=======================================================================

Download the source from

	http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html

and expand it into a directory on the Desktop.

Note: the full path of the directory should not contain any spaces.

Open a terminal window and set up the Visual Studio command line environment

	c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat

then move to the win32 directory in the archive

	cd Desktop\libxslt-1.1.26\win32

Edit the file

	Makefile.msvc

by commenting out the line

	DFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) /OPT:NOWIN98

and also change

	libxml2.lib

to

	libxml2_a.lib

throughout.

Run the commands (changing the include= & lib= paths as appropriate)

	cscript configure.js static=yes debug=no cruntime=-MT include="\\VBOXSVR\BaseElements-Plugin\Headers;\\VBOXSVR\BaseElements-Plugin\Headers\iconv" lib="\\VBOXSVR\BaseElements-Plugin\Libraries"
	nmake -f Makefile.msvc MFLAGS=-MT libxslta libexslta

to configure and build the source.

Finally, place the headers from the directories

	libxslt-1.1.26\include\libxslt & libxslt-1.1.26\include\libexslt

into directories, libxslt & libexslt, in the Headers directory and copy the libraries

	bin.msvc\libxslt_a.lib & bin.msvc\libexslt_a.lib

into the Libraries directory.


=======================================================================
OpenSSL
=======================================================================

Building OpenSSL requires that perl is installed. The ActiveState perl (Community Edition) is a good
place to start if you do not already have perl installed

	http://www.activestate.com/activeperl


Download the latest openssl source from

	http://www.openssl.org/source/

(openssl-1.0.0d.tar.gz at the time of writing).

Unpack the archive onto the desktop and, using the command prompt

	cd c:\Users\Mark\Desktop\openssl-1.0.0d
	perl Configure VC-WIN32 enable-static-engine no-asm
	ms\do_nt
	c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat
	nmake -f ms\nt.mak


	Copy libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib to Libraries and copy includes/openssl to Headers.

=======================================================================
libcurl
=======================================================================

Note: OpenSSL must be built before building libcurl.

Download the source from

	http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

and expand it into a directory on the Desktop.

Open
	vc6curl.dsw

and set the following Configuration Properties:

	General -> Use of MFC == Use MFC in a Static Library
	C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions ... add USE_SSLEAY
	C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions ... add USE_OPENSSL
	C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library == Multi-threaded (/MT)
	VC++ Directories -> Include Directories -> add the path to the BEPlugin Headers directory


In Visual Studio and select "Batch Build" and check the "LIB Release" configuration and then "Build".

Copy the library from

	curl-7.22.0\lib\LIB-Release\libcurl.lib

into the Libraries directory and copy

	curl-7.22.0\include\curl

to the Headers directory.
