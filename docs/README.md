The BaseElements Plugin is a Claris FileMaker plugin, that is free, open source and available on Mac, Windows and Ubuntu Linux.

It was originally built as a small addition to the BaseElements developer tool, to provide additional required functionality that wasn’t in FileMaker Pro itself. However the free/open nature of it meant that FileMaker developers around the world started using it for their own solutions, and over time it expanded to include more functionality and become more widely used.

The documentation here describes how to install and use the plugin, as well as how to build it from scratch if that interests you. We provide pre built binaries so you don’t need to build your own copy.
