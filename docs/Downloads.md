### Beta Releases ( when available )

Mac 5.1.0b1 : https://goya.com.au/files/beplugin/5.1.0b1/BaseElements.fmplugin.dmg

### iOS versions

iOS Plugin ( requires an SDK app, not FileMaker Go ). Most recent version is 4.2.4, latest version has issues building for iOS and so may require future changes. We don't have a lot of requests for the iOS version and so will evaluate exactly what functions we include in future releases.

### Old FileMaker Server Centos versions

Version 4.0 through to 4.1.4 was available as a linux build, for FMS running on Centos ONLY.   As of 4.2.0, centos support was removed, and replaced with support for Ubuntu.  If you're running Centos still and require the plugin, we recommend version 4.1.4 :

### Code Signed Plugins for FileMaker 18 ( Pro and Server ) and later

The downloadable versions of 3.3.8 above, and any 4.x release from 4.0.5 or later will be code signed.  So it will load in FileMaker Server and won't show a dialog in FileMaker Pro.

### Notarized Plugins for Mac OS 10.15 Catalina and later

Mac OS 10.15 and later versions require applications ( including FileMaker Pro and any plugins you're using ) to be both code signed, and notarized to run without any alerts or issues.
Versions 4.1.2 and later are notarized as well as code signed, and should run without any alerts.

## Older versions

The last version for Windows 32 bit ( Pro and Server ) is 3.3.8.  All future releases of the BaseElements plugin will be 64 bit only.
