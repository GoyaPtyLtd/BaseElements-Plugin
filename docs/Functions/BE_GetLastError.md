## BE_GetLastError

    BE_GetLastError

**Description**  

Returns the last error generated by the most recent plugin function call.  This value is overridden on every function call, except for calls to BE_GetLastError, BE_GetLastDDLError, and BE_DebugInformation.

This function does not set many of the error results themselves, so there is no definitive list of possible values, and new codes are introduced with each updated library.  Use the links below to lookup error codes for various values.

The plugin does return 0 on successful function calls and 1 to match the "User canceled action" for dialog cancel buttons, and 3 for function calls where the operating system is known to be incompatible. 

**Parameters**

NA

**Keywords**  

Error Last Get

**Version History**

* 1.2.0 : First Release
* 2.0.0 : Changed the way this works so that successive calls to the BE_GetLastError function don't reset the value that is returned, it's only reset when performing any other function call.

**Notes**

Most of the error codes are returned by libraries we use or the OS itself, not by the plugin, so there are very few "plugin" error codes.  Most error codes are either cURL related, file system related, or OS related.

In the case of the *HTTP*, *FTP*, *SMTP* etc functions we're using the cURL libraries. There is a list of error codes here :

When doing Windows file operations, common errors are :
